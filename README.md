# FAST_TANKS
FAST_TANKS is a 2 person tank battle game, written for NES in 6502 assembly language. It is compiled using dasm.exe the 8-bit macro assembler. It has been tested on FCEUX a NES emulator. YY-CHR was used for sprite editing and creation. Subroutines, loops and variables that end in a "0" belong to tank1/ball1/player1 - currently the black tank. This first tank is referred to as tank0. Subroutines, loops and variables that end in "1" belong to tank2/ball2/player2 - currently the red tank. This second tank is referred to as tank1. The bullet is referred to as the ball in the code. Same ball0, ball1 logic as for the tanks. If the subroutine and/or loop ends in neither a "0" nor "1" it is for the game overall. There are exceptions to this rule, but they are limited. The processing for tank1 is identical to that for tank0. You really only have to read the code for half
the application (tank0 half) to know what's going on. This is not a multi-threaded app, there are limitations. One limititation is when both tanks fire simultaneously,
the second tank burps out the bullet. Special thanks to the gang at http://8bitworkshop.com/. I used and modified their nesdefs.dasm and nesppu.dasm files. These files were a
great help. My tank.chr is also a modification of jroatch.chr that I downloaded from 8bitworkshop.
